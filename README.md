**CSV to ICS creation with subscription-ready output**

This project streamlines the process of converting CSV-based event data into `.ics` calendar files. While future versions may support direct CSV upload and web-based conversion, the current implementation operates via command-line for fast, reliable generation.

I built this tool to simplify the chaos of managing my children's high school and middle school sports schedules. Most calendars are distributed in Word or PDF format, which makes syncing to mobile devices repetitive, tedious, and error-prone. Mass updates are nearly impossible.

With this project, I can quickly update a CSV spreadsheet, generate `.ics` files, and publish calendars via GitHub hosting. My workflow typically involves copying calendar text, formatting it in Excel, and converting it into structured columns. Once complete, I commit the changes and the calendars are instantly available for subscription.
